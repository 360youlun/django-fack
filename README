django-faq v.1.0
================

An extremely simple FAQ application for your Django powered site. I also made
note to provide this app as an example of creating a reusable app following
best practices - allowing for template overrides, extra_context arguments,
etc. So in theory you should be able to drop it on your Python path and get
going pretty easy. I noted where appropriate some of the details. Search for
'#NOTE' to see where I left those tidbits of info that provide some more
details within the code.

Installation
============

1. add 'faq' directory to your Python path.
2. add 'faq' to your INSTALLED_APPS tuple found in your settings file.
3. If you want to customize the templates then either create an 'faq'
   directory in your projects templates location, or you can also pass along
   custom 'template_name' arguments by creating your own view wrappers around
   the 'faq' app views. I show how to do the latter in the 'example' project
   included - look at the views.py file to see the details.

Example Site
============

I included an example site in the /example directory. You should be able to
simply execute './manage.py syncdb' and then './manage.py runserver' and have
the example site up and running. I assume your system has sqlite3 available -
it is set as the default database with the DATABASE_NAME = 'faq.db'
